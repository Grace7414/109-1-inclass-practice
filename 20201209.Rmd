## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}



get_courses <- function(acadYear_i, grade_i, courseStructure){
  pick <-
  (courseStructure$學年==acadYear_i 
    &
    str_detect(courseStructure$應修系級, grade_i))
  browser() # 暫停點(1)
  return(
    unique(courseStructure$科目名稱[pick])
  )
}


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
