## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
author <- c("Martin老師", "mtlin@gm.ntpu.edu.tw", "2020-03-25T07:17:40Z")

committer <- c("emilyluckey", "emily007@gmail.com", "2020-03-26T08:18:40Z")

message <- c("update")

commit <- list(
  author, committer, message
)
print(commit)
```
