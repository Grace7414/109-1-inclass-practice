## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
restaurant = "すき家 Sukiya (新北三峽店)"
date = lubridate::mdy("Nov 10, 2020")
order = list(
  list(
    item="蕃茄牛丼",
    quantity=1
  ) # 這裡少了一筆 "起司蕃茄牛丼"
)
total = 328
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
